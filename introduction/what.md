# Welcome to Wick
Wick is a highly reliable Discord Bot that prioritizes moderation, security, and utility. It sets itself apart from other conventional bots by providing unparalleled protection against potential threats that may harm your server. In fact, Wick is currently trusted by some of the largest servers on Discord and has consistently proven itself to be the best moderation bot for several years.

While Wick has some opinionated filters that are informed by our experience dealing with nukers and raiders, it still offers ample room for customization to server owners. This flexibility allows owners to tailor their moderation environments to meet their unique needs and preferences. In summary, if you're looking for a reliable and highly effective bot to help safeguard your server, look no further than Wick.

## Features
Hello there! If you're looking for a bot that can handle moderation, security, and protection for your server, then look no further than Wick! This bot is packed with features that will help keep your server safe and secure.

One of Wick's most notable features is its advanced Auto Mod. With customizable heat filters, you can tailor the bot's behavior to your specific needs. Wick's automod comes with dozens of filters, and offers more customizability and granularity than other bots or even Discord's own Automod.

Wick also boasts a Super Powerful Anti-Nuke system, designed to protect against potential "rogue" admins from Mass Creating/Deleting Channels and Roles, Mass Kicking and Banning members, and more. With various lockdown modes at your disposal, you can lock down specific channels, the entire server, roles, joins, and even invites.

The bot's Powerful Gate System is another standout feature, allowing you to monitor users that join and target those that meet/trigger your set filters. It can even filter out bots your staff might bring in without your permission.

Verification is another area where Wick shines. You can have your new members go through Wick's unique verification process, which can take place on Discord or on Wick's own platform. With several different solutions offered, you can easily filter out user bots.

Wick also offers a robust set of moderation commands, with everything you need to keep your server running smoothly. These commands are offered as both Slash Commands and Prefix Commands, alongside user actions. And with plenty of utility methods and logs available, Wick is a versatile and reliable bot for any server.
