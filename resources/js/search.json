It sets itself apart from other conventional bots by providing unparalleled protection against potential threats that may harm your server. In fact, Wick is currently trusted by some of the largest servers on Discord and has consistently proven itself to be the best moderation bot for several years.","While Wick has some opinionated filters that are informed by our experience dealing with nukers and raiders, it still offers ample room for customization to server owners. This flexibility allows owners to tailor their moderation environments to meet their unique needs and preferences. In summary, if you're looking for a reliable and highly effective bot to help safeguard your server, look no further than Wick."]},{"l":"Quick Start","p":["Note that the setup time may take a while.","Incorporating Wick into your server is a straightforward procedure that can be easily accomplished. To begin, navigate to the Wick website and authorize it to join your server. This process is swift and uncomplicated, and after Wick has been integrated into your server, you can quickly get started.","One of the most efficient ways to initiate Wick is through its wizard setup, which will assist you in the setup process and get everything up and running in no time. Alternatively, you can also manually configure Wick by following the instructions in this documentation.","After Wick has been incorporated into your server, you can begin utilizing its features by typing commands in your Discord channel. The prefix for Wick's commands is \"w!\", so be sure to use it before every command you enter. With Wick at your disposal, you can leverage its powerful moderation tools, security features, and other functionalities."]},{"l":"Features","p":["Hello there! If you're looking for a bot that can handle moderation, security, and protection for your server, then look no further than Wick! This bot is packed with features that will help keep your server safe and secure.","One of Wick's most notable features is its advanced Auto Mod. With customizable heat filters, you can tailor the bot's behavior to your specific needs. Wick's automod comes with dozens of filters, and offers more customizability and granularity than other bots or even Discord's own Automod.","Wick also boasts a Super Powerful Anti-Nuke system, designed to protect against potential \"rogue\" admins from Mass Creating/Deleting Channels and Roles, Mass Kicking and Banning members, and more. With various lockdown modes at your disposal, you can lock down specific channels, the entire server, roles, joins, and even invites.","The bot's Powerful Gate System is another standout feature, allowing you to monitor users that join and target those that meet/trigger your set filters. It can even filter out bots your staff might bring in without your permission.","Verification is another area where Wick shines. You can have your new members go through Wick's unique verification process, which can take place on Discord or on Wick's own platform. With several different solutions offered, you can easily filter out user bots.","Wick also offers a robust set of moderation commands, with everything you need to keep your server running smoothly. These commands are offered as both Slash Commands and Prefix Commands, alongside user actions. And with plenty of utility methods and logs available, Wick is a versatile and reliable bot for any server."]},{"l":"Support","p":["For any technical support questions or concerns related to Wick, I encourage you to reach out to its support team through the Discord server. You can join the support server by clicking on the following link: support server.","The support team is available 24/7 and is highly knowledgeable, so feel free to ask them any questions you may have. They will do their best to assist you with any issues you encounter.","If you happen to come across any bugs or would like to request a new feature, the support team would love to hear from you. They will work closely with the development team to address your concerns and continuously improve the product."]}],[{"i":"wicks-features","l":"Wick's Features","p":["By using Wick's verification system, raid accounts can be eliminated, while allowing genuine new members to join with ease.","Discord servers often face the challenge of raiding, which has resulted in the adoption of temporary solutions such as kicking new accounts that join the server. However, such a practice can lead to the loss of genuine new members, which is contrary to the recommended approach by Discord.","Discover the full capabilities of Wick's Anti-Nuke system and its panic mode feature, and protect your server against rogue admins and other members who may attempt to cause harm.","During a lockdown, Wick simultaneously deploys a miniWick that retrieves server information before the nuke trigger, separate from the Wick bot to avoid overburdening its resources. Once the causes are identified and fixed, Wick will load the latest snippet of the server saved through its Restore System, which operates in two scenarios.","For instance, Wick can detect accounts without avatars, which are often associated with raiding bots and spammers. In addition, administrators can establish age requirements for new accounts and even take action against unauthorized bot additions.","If Imaging (Backups) is enabled, Wick will save a backup of the server at regular intervals and load the latest backup when a nuke occurs. Anything that does not match the image will be removed and all deletions that occurred during that short span of time will be reverted back to normal. If Imaging is disabled, Wick will use its memory and Discord to restore the server, although this process may be finicky and may not result in complete restoration.","Moreover, admins can access a comprehensive log of all activity captured by JoinRaid, including a link to Wick's website that provides a complete list of identified accounts. We encourage you to consider implementing JoinRaid as part of your server management strategy to proactively address potential security threats.","The Heat System is a crucial tool in managing raids and spam in Wick. It employs an adaptive algorithm known as Heat that adjusts to user actions and scales appropriately with an increase in member activity. Wick also utilizes hidden filters to analyze messages and user behavior, contributing to the total heat which diminishes over time to prevent regular members from being wrongfully silenced. The Heat System factors in a range of message elements, including message repetition, suspicion, advertisement, NSFW and malicious websites, emojis, characters, new lines, mentions, attachments, and blacklist words and links. The system also includes Auto Timeouts and a Panic Mode for targeting raiders, as well as an Auto Lockdown feature to prevent damage from ping raids. Each Heat Filter has its own percentage and action set if triggered, making it a versatile tool for maintaining server security.","The verification system can be personalized by configuring the various settings according to the server's needs and the preferences of its admins. The system scales to the user's input settings to ensure optimal performance.","To address the issue of potential server raids, we suggest utilizing JoinRaid, a tool designed to monitor the influx of account joins over a specified time period and detect any suspicious activity. JoinRaid employs a range of algorithms to flag potentially problematic accounts and trigger immediate action, such as issuing warnings to designated roles or taking punitive measures against flagged accounts and their associated contributors. JoinRaid runs continuously and is not limited by any joingate constraints.","To address this issue, Wick offers an advanced verification system with multiple modes that can be customized to suit different types of servers, including big servers, NFT/Crypto servers, among others. The verification system is highly configurable and can target everyone or just suspicious accounts, using options such as Captcha, web verification, or instant verification.","To ensure the security of your community, Wick offers an on-join security system that utilizes multiple filters to identify potential security threats. Acting as a firewall, this system enables administrators to establish their own preferences for what actions should be taken in response to specific triggers.","To further safeguard your community, Wick can also filter out unverified bots and accounts that contain discord invites. Moreover, you can now use Wick's username filter to target accounts with specific usernames that fall under your requirements.","To maintain the integrity of this system, Wick also notes any attempts to bypass it and takes appropriate measures, such as stripping off the power of rogue admins or members and quarantining them. The panic mode feature is a complex and efficient system that allows Wick to effectively fend off rapid mass nukes that may be initiated through scripts or specialized bots.","We highly recommend enabling the Bot Addition Filter for all server owners. With customizable filters and actions, Wick's JoinGate system provides a powerful tool for ensuring the security and integrity of your community.","Wick will never ask users to scan a QR code to access a specific server.","Wick's Anti-Nuke system sets it apart from other Discord Bots with its ability to monitor and detect any changes, planned or spontaneous, that occur within a server. This system is designed to safeguard against actions that can potentially harm your server, such as creation or deletion of channels/roles, bans/kicks, and creation or deletion of webhooks."]}],[{"i":"#","p":["Sapphire's setup is fast and smooth, thanks to its easy-to-use dashboard interface.

After the automated setup, a new role named Quarantine will be created, which should be positioned directly under the Wick role to prevent unauthorized access. It is important to note that Wick's functionality is dependent on the existence of the Quarantine role.","If you are unable to locate the Quarantine role after setup, please run \"w!setup\" to ensure proper configuration."]},{"i":"wicks-statics","l":"Wick's Statics","p":["To gain a better understanding of Wick's functionalities, it is important to familiarize oneself with the Statics feature, which encompasses roles, channels, and users that Wick depends on. Please note that some Statics, such as the Quarantine role, #logs, and #modlogs, are automatically generated during setup.","If you are not the Physical Server Owner and wish to set up Wick, the server owner must add you as an Extra Owner using the command \"w!statics USER ?add 11,\" where USER is replaced by your username, mention, or ID.","In terms of roles, Main Roles are crucial for Wick's functionality and are zero-permission roles that you give to all members in your server. To add a Main Role, use the command \"w!statics role ?add 5,\" followed by the role's mention, name, or ID. It is important to note that Main Roles should not have any dangerous permissions.","Static Channels refer to channels that are set once and for all, such as the Logging, Mod-Logging, Partnering, and Main Channels. To set a partnering channel, use the command \"w!statics CHANNEL ?set 8,\" where CHANNEL is replaced by the channel's mention, name, or ID. To set the Main Channel, use the command \"w!statics CHANNEL ?set 9,\" again replacing CHANNEL with the appropriate mention, name, or ID.","Static Users consist of Trusted Admins and Extra Owners, who have immunity and will never be punished by Wick for their actions. To add a Trusted Admin, use the command \"w!statics user ?add 10,\" followed by the user's mention, username, usertag, or ID. To add an Extra Owner, use the command \"w!statics user ?add 11,\" again specifying the user's details. While it is not recommended to add Trusted Admins or Extra Owners, it is advisable to add your alternate account as an Extra Owner in case you lose access to your main account."]},{"l":"Whitelist Stuff","p":["To ensure optimal service with minimal risk of false positives, whitelisting is a crucial step. The table below outlines the objects that can be whitelisted based on their respective commands and types:","Member w!whitelist @member","Role w!whitelist @role","Channel w!whitelist #channel","Category w!whitelist category-id","Webhook w!whitelist webhook-id","In addition to the above, you have the option to whitelist permit roles (i.e., staff roles you have designated within Wick) from Antinuke limitations and blacklist words. This can be done on a case-by-case basis or through a total whitelist, which exempts objects from the entirety of Automod. By taking advantage of these features, you can customize your experience with Wick to suit your needs."]},{"l":"Automated Moderation","p":["It is strongly advised to review the Whitelist section before attempting to set up the Auto Mod in order to avoid complications. Wick utilizes an adaptive algorithm known as Heat, which sets it apart from other moderation bots, and utilizes public and hidden filters to analyze messages and behavior in channels.

Fortunately, there is a setup guide and a wizard available to guide you through the process and ensure a smooth setup experience.","It is important to treat Wick with the same level of caution as you would an antivirus program. Always exercise caution when making decisions in your server, just as you would with your computer.","If you are unable to find a new role named Wick in your server, it is likely because you did not grant the bot the necessary permissions during the setup process.","Please note that only individuals with permit 4/5 (Trusted Admins/Extra Owners) have the authority to set up Wick. It is important to exercise caution when granting these permits and only give them to individuals you trust.","In the event that Wick displays the message \"Wick lacks certain permissions to function properly\" during setup, this indicates that the bot does not have the necessary permissions to operate effectively in your server. To resolve this issue, grant Wick ADMIN permissions."]},{"l":"Wick Control","p":["When it comes to managing Wick, it's important to have a plan in place in case of unexpected circumstances. One scenario that may arise is losing access to the owner account. In such a case, it is recommended to utilize the Rescue key step in the wizard, which provides a QR code for two-factor authentication or Auty, as well as a key to copy and save for future use. It is also wise to add an alternative owner to your account, should the need arise for additional access.","As for who can access the Dashboard and manage Wick's features, there are two user types to consider: Extra Owners and Trusted Admins. Extra Owners have full access and control over the account, with the exception of adding more Extra Owners. They are completely immune to Wick. Trusted Admins can access the Dashboard but are limited in their ability to manage the Miscellaneous and Anti-Nuke settings. They too are completely immune to Wick.

Here, Wick provides a summary of any issues that require attention, an overview of system functionality, and other pertinent information. While it is impossible to guarantee complete immunity to attacks, a server that adheres to recommended security practices will be substantially more secure."]},{"l":"Punishments","p":["When encountering issues related to punishments in Wick, it is important to approach the situation in a methodical manner. If Wick failed to punish a user, there could be several reasons why this occurred. One possible explanation could be a faulty setup. Please ensure that the Quarantine role is correctly placed and located in the appropriate position within the statistics. Additionally, it is possible that the user has been whitelisted from punishment for a particular filter. You can verify whether or not a user is whitelisted by running the command \"w!info USER\".","If you are experiencing issues with Wick punishing your ticket bot, this is likely due to Wick's antinuke system. Wick will react to any attempts to destroy your server, including those made by the ticket bot. However, you can whitelist the category where the ticket bot operates by running the command \"w!anp CATEGORY-ID ?add 6\".","In the event that Wick is deleting your webhooks, it is recommended that you ensure that the webhooks are not performing any suspicious or harmful actions. If the webhooks are harmless, you can whitelist them to prevent Wick from deleting them.","Lastly, if you are encountering issues with Wick punishing your auto roles bot, it is likely due to the bot attempting to assign roles to Quarantined members. To resolve this issue, you can add the bot to the Quarantine whitelist or disable its auto role feature and use Wick's instead. With Wick's verification system, users who pass the verification process will automatically receive the main roles that you have designated in the statistics."]},{"l":"Response","p":["In the event that you encounter any issues with Wick, we encourage you to refer to the following information.","If Wick is not responding, it may be due to permissions.
